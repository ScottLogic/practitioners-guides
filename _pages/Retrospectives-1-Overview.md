description: A general overview of Agile Retrospective meetings and the different approaches a team can take to improvement.
---

## Introduction
Retrospectives are considered by some to be the most powerful meeting in Agile methodologies. They are the mechanism by which we learn from past iterations and improve future iterations. Most people are familiar with some variation of the format:
- What went well last sprint?
- What problems did we encounter last sprint?
- What actions can we take to improve our next sprint?

This is a fine format and has become a standard for a good reason - it cuts to the core of the what iterative development is about - using past data to empirically improve future performance.

However, there are times when this format does not serve us as well. Some examples are:
- The team is new and they do not know each other well - team members are shy about participating.
- Retrospectives have become predictable and the team is losing engagement.
- We want to examine a greater time period, such as a project or a quarter.
- We want to focus on a specific, long term, objective.
- We want to focus on a specific, large issue.

In these cases, and others, there are different retrospective formats that may help your team achieve the outcomes they desire. 

This series of guides contain a collection of alternative retrospective formats with details of how to run them and why you want want to.

Many of these formats will have been seen before but are presented in a way that you can dip in and out of them and use this as a reference guide. Whether you are a seasoned retrospective facilitator or running a retro with your team for the first time there should be something for you here.

### Principles of a Retro
Retrospectives are a time for the team to come together and raise how they currently feel about the work and team and help identify improvements and changes we want to make to the process. They should be for the team to shape and have the opportunity to control. I have found the following principles to be good to bear in mind when setting up retros with my teams.

- **Regular & Scheduled**: Don’t get to the end of an iteration and go “well we should probably have a retro now” or be frantically trying to find a time in the calendar to discuss how we work. Get a regular slot in everyone’s calendars that everyone in the team can make.  
- **Time-boxed**: Retros that run on for hour after hour can be a drag on everyone’s time and attention. Since we have the whole team in attendance we should be intentional with that time and use it appropriately. If a discussion about an issue is going on too long, consider setting up a specific follow-up session just to discuss that with the interested parties and move on to what affects the whole team.
- **Looking inward on the Team, with only the team involved**: Identify who the team is (the people who are actively working together every day) and who should therefore be in retrospective. You should not have external observers or occasional stakeholders in the retro as they are not beholden to the actions of the retro.
- **Structured and facilitated**: You don’t want to go into a retro and suddenly discover no one knows what you are going to do for a session. Plan out in advance who is facilitating and what activities they’ll run. In the early weeks of a team this should be someone experienced (e.g. the scrum master or team lead). As time goes on it’s great to share this around the team and get more people involved.
- **A safe space**: It is incredibly important that every participant in the retro feels as if they can raise issues to the wider team. This is perhaps best expressed in the Retrospective Prime Directive:

> **“Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”** -Norm Kerth

##### Top Tip
>###### Running Remote Retros
>All of the guidance is intended to be generic enough to apply to teams running retros in any setting. Typically the advice has been written with software delivery in mind (as that’s our speciality) but could also be applied wider than that.
>
>The formats expressed below are designed to be run in person or remote without needing to change them. Minimum requirements for an online tool:
>
>- Everyone can see and interact with the board
>- The facilitator can define their own format for the retro
>- We can create notes, move them around and mark them with votes

### Structure of a Retrospective
So, you’ve got a time, a place (online or physical), you know who’s coming to the retro and who is facilitating. Now, you need to plan out how the actual meeting will run. In general, I split up most retros into 3 sections. 

1. **Icebreaker** - An opening activity designed to get people talking and thinking about their feelings on the current work. Often a 5-10 minute activity up front. See our upcoming article about Icebreakers for inspiration.
1. **Main Activity** - The actual format we are using. We will spend the majority of the time gathering notes from everybody in the retro according to our current format and discussing these items to identify themes and commonality.
1. **Action Setting** - Reserve the last 10-15 minutes of the retro for setting actions and ensuring that everyone knows the next steps. See more about setting good actions in our upcoming article.

### Retrospective Types

To help distinguish between different styles of retrospective, we’ve split up the formats into loose categories: Optimising Process, Looking Back, Looking Forward and Focus Retros. 

**Optimising Process Retros**: These retrospectives are the standard style of retro, typically aiming to:

- Look back at last sprint/iteration
- Identify things that are good
- Identify areas where we can improve
- Decide where to focus energy on improving how we work

Optimising process retros are your bread and butter of retros. Most of the retros your team will want to run will be like this and the formats serve to help you make focused change over time.

**Looking Back Retros**: Whilst in most retrospectives we are focusing on the most recent iteration/sprint it is also very important for us to reflect back over a longer period of time - particularly when we consider just how far a team might’ve come in 6 months or a year of working on a project. This family of retrospectives is getting the team to “Cast their minds back” to the past of the project, reminding us of older challenges, key events and achievements that have happened to this team.  

A “Looking Back” retro can also be used as part of a wider review session, for example at the end of a year or setting the scene for how we can plan for the next longer period of work.

**Looking Forward Retros**: These retrospectives are for looking ahead at longer term goals and aspirations, typically:

- Looking forward to goals/objectives/vision/direction
- Identify things that will help us on this journey
- Identify things that will slow us down/hinder us

**Focus Retros**: These focus on specific activities to run when you want to Focus on an aspect of the team. Examples include:

- What are our biggest challenges? You may choose "Circles and Soup"
- What is our vision for the future of the team? You may choose the "Resolutions Retro"
- How do we feel about the meetings we attend? ESVP may be applicable.

##### Top Tip
>###### Walking the Board
>In lots of these retro formats we suggest “Walking the Board”. Effectively this is just a process where you as the facilitator will read out loud every single item that has been raised for the whole team to acknowledge. During this time you are trying to clarify things in case they aren’t clear to everyone and answering questions the team asks about them. You should add detail to notes if it helps clarify.
>
>However, you should be careful that you don’t start discussing the notes at this step. We only want to acknowledge “Do we all know what this means?” not “Do we agree with this?”. The temptation is to keep the conversation going but at this step we just want to cover everything raised fairly, equally and setting up a platform where the team can then vote on what they want to discuss.
