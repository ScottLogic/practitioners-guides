## Introduction

So you want to be a Mentor!

Well, this may come as a surprise, but, it's not rocket science, and... you already are a mentor!

Yes, you are already in the privileged position of being able to mentor somebody, this may be a graduate,
a member of your project team, your client, or even your life partner!

Mentoring can sometimes seem a little scary, after all, your mentee is relying on you to guide them responsibly,
accurately, and with confidence. It is essential therefore that you know your limitations and backoff when you
feel you are leaving your 'comfort zone'. There is no shame in saying ``I don't know`` to your mentee, but is
just as helpful if you follow that up with, ``but I know who might``.

This guide will hopefully help you understand what your role as a mentor is and where your responsibilities lie

## Are you the right mentor?

Do you have the skills that match the mentee aspirations? It's no good being the world's best java developer
if your mentee want's to become proficient in, say Bee Keeping, and you have no experience of it.

If your skills and experience don't match the aspirations of your mentee it is time to find a different
mentor for them to hand over the reins to, or, supplement your skills with extra mentors that can fill
in the gaps. You don't need to know everything the mentee requires, in fact that is a great mentoring
topic i.e. discovering and using the other resources around them.

As an example, you may be great at managing the development process and can impart your skills and
knowledge at managing say the agile process, but your hands on development skills may be a little
rusty and so you could hand that skill over to a mentor that is more current with modern practices.

If multiple mentors are involved, while everybody has their own unique ways of working, take care
not to confuse the mentee by presenting different conflicting ideas and methodologies, unless of
course it is to allow the mentee to appreciate that different projects and circumstances may require
different approaches to a problem, but you should be very clear that you are presenting alternatives
and not just "the right way".

## Your Job as a mentor

So, in general, your responsibilities as a mentor are to:

- Understand the aspirations and background of your mentee,

  You need to understand what your mentee wants to achieve, where they are starting from and what are their
  weaknesses (although their weaknesses will be unravelled as your mentor-mentee relationship develops)

- Decide if you are the right mentor?

  If your mentor-mentee relationship is going to be a success you must match your knowledge and experience to
  the aspirations of the mentee

  Once you understand your mentee, you can then lean on your own experience, knowledge and skills to help guide
  and fill in the blanks for them, essentially making them a better you, helping them navigate past
  all of those mistakes you made along the way,

- Ensure that your mentee “owns” any decisions they make

  It is part of the process for the mentee to make mistakes, to experiment and make decisions as they mature,
  it is essential that they “own” any decisions they make, this will give them a sense of achievement and
  pride when they solve any problems they have

- Provide feedback, encouragement and suggestions

  Always provide feedback to anything the mentee does, this should always be positive, things like
  ``that’s great, but what if you…`` helps encourage them to think about problems when
  given new input, make sure they aren’t afraid to change a decision based on input and that they don’t
  just blindly follow a path that they think is wrong.

- Set them free

  Finally, you must understand when to set them free on their own path. However, you should always make yourself 
  available for advice or as a sounding board if they want support in the future. If you have done well, the
  mentee will become a mentor in their own right passing their skills and any new ones they have gained through
  your guidance to their mentee.

These steps are very much the same regardless of who your mentee is, the biggest difference will be how you
deliver feedback, encouragement and suggestions as that will all be dependent upon your mentee chosen field.

## Mentoring in practice

Mentoring is highly focused on skills and knowledge transfer and as such the approach to mentoring will always
be dependent on the specific requirements of the mentee. As a practical example of mentoring, let’s take a look
a mentoring somebody that has chosen to become a software developer.

We are not going to go into how you should mentor in the effective use of any tools that are used in the software
development process, that should be the subject of a separate series of articles, instead we will focus on more
generic aspects of a software developer, just mentioning some of the tools that you and your mentee may come across.

### Understanding your mentee

What field(s) do they want to be proficient in? For our software developer, this may be one or more of
java, c#, spring, typescript, react, git, jira etc.

Work out what their current level of expertise is, and where they feel they need development.

Is your mentee undergoing solo training or are they part of a larger team, it should be noted that for
software developers specifically it is an important part of their individual development to experience working
as a team member on a larger project as that will reflect their real life work experience. However, as a
mentor, you may not be involved in both the solo and group projects with them, still, you should make yourself
available if they have questions that relate to your skills.

### The mentoring process

There must be a plan in place to allow the mentee to develop their skills in a progressive manner, this may be in
the form of a solo project, followed by a group project where there is a need for the mentee to understand how
to work effectively both as a team member and under the direction of a product owner or client.

For our budding software developer, this may be a two-step process...

1. a specification for a small solo project that you would like
  them to complete on their own which will encompass a wide range of knowledge use and acquisition that builds
  as they progress, this project will lay a foundation that allows them to develop and build the skills around
  the tools they will need in the future.
2. a specification for a larger project and introduction to other mentees that will form a small team that will
  allow all the mentees to understand the collaborative tools they will use and the interpersonal skills they
  will need to effectively work as a part of a team.

Projects should have a well-defined start and end specification and timescale, this will give the mentee a
sense of accomplishment when they see their work has a defined endpoint, and they see it running.

Depending on the aspirations of the mentee, any solo project will most likely cover one or more of the following topics:

- Frontend/backend design
  UX, Design Patterns etc.
- Technology choice
  Language(s), Open/Closed source etc.
- Testing
  Methodologies, End to End, Unit etc.

These topics should involve the necessity for the mentee to fact find and liaise with other sources of
knowledge (other mentees, mentors or the wider community).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Top Tip
----------------------------------------------------------------------
While a mentee may not require all of these skills as a software developer, it is
good that they have an understanding and appreciation of all aspects of development, this will allow them to
discuss and debate with their peers with a level of confidence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Once a solo project is complete, the mentee should have a good grounding in most aspects of software development,
they should now build on those by undertaking a group project.

A typical group project will also cover the same topics as the solo project, but also introduce the tools that
allow the mentee to work collaboratively and organise the development process i.e.

- requirement/issue reporting, prioritization, assignment and tracking
- collaborative code management
- process methodology, e.g. Agile (Scrum, Kanban), Waterfall etc.

It is important for the mentee to understand and navigate the complexities of working in a project team, to 
this end, any such project should simulate a real-life experience as much as possible and should take into 
consideration:

- division of work
- conflict resolution
  How to deal with awkward team members, product owner/customer or differences of opinion
- working fixed timescales (sprint length, project end date etc.)
  Task prioritisation, scope and refinement
- how to ensure quality of work
  UX design, Design patterns, Testing, Peer review
- regular updates to project owner

----------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Top Tip
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There should be one or more mentors that act in the roles of product owner and team lead, it is
important that the mentors undertaking these roles devote enough time and use all their skills to ensure the
team of mentees is always on point and are not left to their own devices.
