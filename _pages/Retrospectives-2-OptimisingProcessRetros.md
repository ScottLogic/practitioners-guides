## Introduction
This guide provides templates to run retrospectives aimed at optimising a teams process. For a general overview and description of the different kinds of retrospectives covered the these guides please see our [Retrospectives - Overview]( {{ site.baseurl }} {% link _pages/Retrospectives-1-Overview %})

## Keep, Stop, Start
The Keep, Stop, Start (or Stop, Start, Continue or any variant) is the classic retrospective format that most of will have used.

### Why should I use it?
The old faithful. Identify what is working well for the team, what isn’t and what new ideas people have to bring.
- **Good For**: a simple repeatable format to uncover small improvements for ways of working
- **Not so Good For**: variety; Keep, Stop, Start is rather plain and can get dull running from sprint-to-sprint. There isn’t much focus on achievement or direction either

### Setup
The facilitator will:
1. Draw 3 columns on the board
1. Label the columns “Keep”, “Stop” and “Start”

### Components
- **KEEP** is for the things that went well in the iteration, good moments, practices that worked well and things we tried last sprint that were good
- **STOP** is for the negatives. Things we’d like to stop doing, don’t want to happen again next iteration and weren’t good for the team. This is the section you’ll likely want to focus on in action setting
- **START** is for new ideas! New suggestions of ways we can improve how we work and try new things

### Running the Retro 
1. Everyone adds notes to all columns. Time-box this to around 10-15 minutes in an hour retro or shorter for less time. Optionally, open the digital board early or getting the team to bring pre-written sticky notes to save time during the retro.
1. “Walk the Board”, starting with Keep, then Stop then Start. Read the notes in each column in order, clarifying anything that the team doesn’t understand. Don't discuss any notes in depth and try to gather related notes together and identify themes.
1. Give all the participants a number of votes, usually between 3 & 5, and get everyone to vote on whichever notes they most want us to action. Allow participants to vote on their own items, use multiple votes on the same item and see how others are voting. 
1. Start discussion on the group of notes with the most votes, potentially with who raised it. As the facilitator, try to hear sentiment from across the room and *gently direct to team to focus on what action we can take related to this note for the next sprint*.
1. Continue with the next most voted notes until time runs out or the team reaches a set of actions they are happy with (no more than 5)

### What should I get out of it?
At the end of the Keep, Stop, Start retro you should have a set of actions ready to take into the next iteration. Not everything will have been fully discussed or resolved but the team should have some focus on what you will be able to change in next sprint.

## Star Shaped Retro
A direct extension to the Keep, Stop, Start format, the Star Shaped Retro adds “More” and “Less” to our categories, allowing us to be a little more nuanced in the notes that the team raises.

### Why should I use it?
If the team is getting too many notes for Keep, Stop, Start or if the team is particularly large; the star-shaped retro can help to illicit more feedback from the team. Conversely if you are struggling to agree what we can “Stop” and “Start” perhaps you can start with “what should we do a little more of/do a little less of”.
- **Good For**: nuance and eliciting smaller issues from the team. 
- **Not so Good For**: focusing on specific topics, expect a broader array of issues raised

### Setup
- Split the board into 5 roughly equal segments 
- Label the sections clockwise: Start, More, Keep, Less, Stop

![Illustration of the board showing page split into 5 sections by lines originating from the centre, labelled Start, More, Keep, Less and Stop]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/retros/StarBoardExample.png)

### Components
- START is for new ideas! New suggestions of ways we can improve how we work and try new things
- MORE is for practices that we’ve started that we want to do more of - or something particularly successful from last iteration that we should try expanding
- KEEP is for the things that went well in the iteration, good moments and practices that worked well
- LESS is for annoyances and slowdowns. These might be necessary tasks/practices that we can’t necessarily stop but doing less of them would be good.
- STOP is for the negatives. Things we’d like to stop doing, don’t want to happen again next iteration and weren’t good for the team.

### Running the Retro
1. Encourage the team to add notes to all sections. Consider challenging everyone to have at least 3 notes on the board in different columns.
1. “Walk the board”, starting with START and going clockwise. 
1. Identify themes across notes and move them around the star to group them up - you can add a prefix of where it came from or reword the note to keep the it making sense.
1. Vote and work through the groups in vote order. Consider focusing on the “MORE” items as simple actions that we can commit to, since we likely will have already started this action.

### What should I get out of it?
At the end of our star-shaped retro we should have a broad array of feedback and some simple things to do more of or start doing and actions to improve the things we want to do less of or stop.

## 4 L’s Retro
A structure for running a retrospective focusing on how we felt about the last sprint and identifying things we learnt.

### Why should I use it?
You want to highlight the positives of our work and recognise that Lessons Learned are a valuable use of our time.
- **Good for**: highlighting positives, hearing about how people feel about the work
- **Not so good for**: teams that don’t feel as if they are learning anything new

#### Setup
- Split the board into 4 equal segments
- Label the segments left-to-right, top-to-bottom “Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For”

![Illustration of the board showing four quarters, labelled Liked, Learned, Lacked and Longed For]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/retros/4LsBoardExample.png)

### Components
- **LIKED** is for the team to raise what they liked about the last iteration! Encourage them to focus on positive pieces of work, assistance from other team members and achievements
- **LEARNED** is for all the interesting and unexpected things we learnt last iteration. Try to get everyone in team to answer this - you should be able to find something new you learned! This can be good to highlight quirks we discovered in our work, new skills or potential future training opportunities for the wider team
- **LACKED** is for those things that didn’t so well. The things that we feel are lacking from our working practices or slow us down
- **LONGED FOR** is all about new suggestions that will make our lives easier. We want to find the things that if we had had before we could’ve completed work quicker/easier/more smoothly

### Running the Retro
1. Give the team some time to add notes to all sections, encouraging that everyone adds at least one note to the Learned section.
1. Start with the Learned section and run through everything in here. Consider if this learning can be extended out to the wider team.
1. “Walk the board” through the rest of the sections, starting with Liked and focusing on achievement and positives. Clarify and group the notes within Lacked and Longed For
1. Using the Lacked and Longed For sections, identify areas we can set actions on. Discuss these one at a time using voting to highlight what the team most wants to improve

### What should I get out of it?
The team should reflect on the positives of the sprint, Liked and Learned gives us more space to discuss the good. At the end we should have actions around the things we lacked and longed for.
